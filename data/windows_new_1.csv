"hello, i have just installed ubuntu on my laptop. the problem is that i don't know how to search wireless connections the way i do with windows. could you help me?",1
where would i find idle from? does it not come with the python linux download (as in for windows),1
(in windows there was a shortcut to idle in programs menu)...,1
"no, you are not locked in. i see ubuntu as a stepping stone from windows to the overall linux world.",1
"and basically what you're telling me is ubuntu has customized linux to the core, thereby having lockins like ms windows.",1

the master has windows on it,1
"i tried a lot on ubuntu 12.04, but couldnt set up. what i want is something like ""connectify"" which works for windows",1
usb file system is windows fat,1
"if mounting a remote file server via nautilus (i think that's it, like the finder in osx or iexplore in windows for browsing the filesysetm), where does that get mounted so i can get to the same directory via the terminal?  i'm unable to see it mounted in /proc/mounts",1

"i'm trying to install 11.04 alpha 3 to a flash drive, i would like to use fat32 so it can be read by windows but for the pre made mount points it won't let me. can i still force it to be root?",1
meh. you leave it plugged all times? i think it's a rule that nobody know... that you should let it drain down at least 3 times per month. once a week or something like that. i remember installing old laptop. windows say 100% but ubuntu was pretty accurate -- bad battery.,1
downside = you still have windows installed,1
grub on the windows hd shouldlent really affect anything,1
windows wont see the  hd.. so no letters...,1

is it windows right now?,1
http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows,1
thanks. me too. i've been at this on one way or another for many weeks. then i got tired of it and have been just using windows.,1
nevermind you are the old-style difficult help. the guys who say reinstall windows.,1
yeah they are running mixed atm... let me try windows on 32 bit,1
"32 bit ubuntu, 64 bit windows",1
think i should switch to 32 bit on windows?,1
"i felt it weird when i tried it, but you can run the 64-bit version on 64-bit windows and 32-bit on 32-bit linux etc, they don't need to be the same arch. might be worth a try anywho. i run the other way though, windows box where i have the mouse+kb then karmic on the one that connects to the windows box",1
"32 or 64-bit windows, 32 or 64-bit karmic?",1
but i dont know what to look at. something similar to pressing ctrlaltdelete on a windows machine and looking at the processor load or so,1
correct. a backport of that specific patch (if that would even be possible) if you'd need windows 7 support. i think #ubuntu-devel might be able to point you in the right direction to get that setup on lanchpad so that it could get backported.,1
"the samba currently available is a bit on the old side, the newer versions have a fix for windows7 shares and a security fix",1

/dev/sdb1 is the windows partition.,1
yes it is the hdd where windows is installed on! lemme try sudo parted /dev/sdb print,1
is /dev/sdb the hard drive where windows is installed?  if so you probably need to specify the partition number,1
"hmm... ikonia i am having a little problem though, i look in /media and windows 7 is there but it has a space in the name.",1

yes i did that but my windows cant see the ubuntu,1
i want to copy my files on to the ubuntu from windows,1
how can i connect my ubuntu with a windows pc via lan,1
it's the equivalent to the user account control (uac) on windows,1
"could anyone tell me how to setup ubuntu with the bottom panal looking somewhat like the one on windows 7? i just want it so the applications i have running are shown as icons, without names. anyone know how to do this?",1
"what card do you have? fwcutter is just the extractor for the windows driver, if i recall",1
samba is so used to access windows shares,1
"you know exactly what was meant by ""using samba to access windows shares"", i think anyone in here knew, and of the 1284 people you're the only one to nit pick about it",1
"of course, one should understand that you want to access windows shares from linux, yet you insist that samba is used to mount those shares as a client accessing the share, which is false by all accounts",1
i am on windows to even get here,1
how can i recover linux after a windows install?,1

and ten install windows?,1
you went on an ubuntu forum to ask for help about windows.,1
i just looked at the palringo website. they don't have a version for linux. their solution is to run wine which is a windows emulation solution which can then run the windows program. not an easy solution,1
"i think you will have to make a command which the screensaver may be able to execute, you will need a linux native screensaver, not a windows one as they are for windows and ubuntu is not windows",1
it will probably work from vlc on windows also.,1

i just installed ubuntu but i can not go to the windows emulator,1

and for some reason no live cds will work. neither will the windows install cd. everything was working fine until i tried installing this on top of windows with special partitioning.,1
is the windows 7 partition expendable?,1
yes most are running on top of a open source setup. with windows though you are better to recover the important stuff and just do a fresh install.,1

if the windows 2003 server is running in a vm?  then that's even more reason to not used the massive windows 2003 just to run a dns server,1
a dns server does not need the entire windows os to do what it does,1
windows server 2003 in my opinion is overkill for a dns server,1
what would be a better dns server to run at home to cache dns. bind 9 or windows server 2003?,1

greetings.. am looking into running lucid at home but need windows for some games.. so looking at virtualization.. virtualbox seems best but are there any guides to taking a running xp ssystem and migrating to virtual box?,1
anyone here have tried running windowsos on virtualbox?,1
if you tell virtual box that you're running windows <whatever> it will choose hardware for the virtual machine that solves all of the driver issues.,1
no. my questions is.. do you still need to install drivers on installed windows in virtualbox?,1
if you install a windowsos on virtual box do you still have to install the drivers? like video card driver sound and the mainboard,1

dual boot means that when you start the computer it asks if you wanna boot windows or linux,1
games (for the most part) on windows do not work in linux.  this is the weakest thing about linux in my opinion.  we have wine (which is not amazing for performance) that allows you to run some windows .exes   it is hit or miss there is a massive community for it: winehq.com,1

the common wisdom for windows laptops is to includ a low powered intel chipset integrated and a high powered ati/nvidia for complicated rendering... and none have support for linux... simply avoid them. 6 months ago i would have told you to go nvidia all the way... but the latest intel drivers rock out with their thing out... with low power consumption. ivybridge notwithstanding.,1

per-application firewalls are standard in windows. i've probably been through at least 5 in my time. a week on ubuntu and i can't even find one. i'm watching stuff from the default install merrily connect out as we speak,1
you switched to windows?,1
"this ""only windows heads want per-app firewalls"" reasoning sounds to me like defending ubuntu by trying to turn a deficiency into a feature. again, i don't understand why it's unreasonable to want to control network access on an application basis. the best argument against it i've heard is basically that linux apps are more trustworthy. i don't work at that level of face-value.",1

look out for an ntfs partition (or vfat if you've installed windows into a fat16/32 partition),1
alt+f2 opens dialogue similar to the the run dialogue in windows,1
"my main hard drive has like 90gb free. i want to make a 15gb partition (can i make it 15gb ext3 and 75gb ntfs?). also, do i install windows first and then linux?",1
"install windows first, make your partition, leave blank space for linux",1
"so do i install windows first, and then grub or what?",1
"better to install windows first, easier to do",1
"and im not even saying that becuase i dont like windows, i mean its really hard to find things in that menu",1

"if there are not linux versions of those packages, you will need to use windows emulation like wine.",1

"first share the printer in windows, and make sure that your windows firewall is opened for that port...",1
then add the printer as windows printer via samba,1
how do i connect to a printer being shared through windows xp?,1
ubuntu usually runs hotter than windows (dont know about fedora though),1
"i agree with lordhelmet , i have found samba a little easier, especially if you do have windows computers on thenetwork",1
"that might have been reasonable on windows or vms -- on the unix, it's not - the rationale is that somebody else puts files into your directories and disappears (leaves the company, etc) you must still be able to have control over the directory (in order to perhaps remove it) and not bother root about this trivial thing",1
"thanks, i know what to do though. just thought those windows designers would have learned how to honor other oss by now",1
"now i'm on windows, when i tried, only firefox was running (sorry for my english) :)",1

the manual install is no harder than the windows manual install...,1
"so they say; i've never bothered.. but it is really, really critical that you shut windows down cleanly. linux won't even try to resize a dirty filesystem",1
"by default if you have ntfs with windows, the installer will resize it, and it suggests about 50:50",1
"i want to use windows for some serious work, so i want windows to work smoothly",1
besides running windows in a window inside ubuntu is so damn cool!,1
"actually i've seen a few causes where ntfs got 'slightly' corrupted (guy dropped his laptop, etc) and windows simply could not read it, not even as a slave drive on another machine. linux handles it just fine apart from a few files that really were damaged.",1
"not surprising, linux does quite a few thousand things better than windows does",1
"yes, but it's always amused my that linux handles slightly damaged ntfs better than windows does, openoffice can read slightly damaged docs that msoffice chokes on, etc..",1
so i would argue that linux handles ntfs 'better' than windows does,1
"tried to explain to him that it's just ""one checkbox"" in windows and he doesn't need to change anything else at all.. nothing on ubuntu because it will get the details from windows....",1
"gah! morons. guy wants ubuntu to connect to his windows machine and share internet, somehow he decided he needs to set up tunneling on windows and use pppoe on ubuntu to do it. ffs!",1

nothing compared to what i see when i use windows,1
i tried to host an ftp server with hundreds of windows ftp softwares and i'm now going to switch to linux and give it a try,1

"hi, im installing ubuntu 7.10 and am at the partioner screen. i have windows xp already installed on a 320 gb drive that has roughly 60 gb free space. at the partion screen, it says ""guided -resize scsi3 (0,0,0) partition #1 (sda) and use freed space"". below that is a ""new partition size:"" bar that allows me to drag the size i want for the partition but at it's lowest setting (dragged all the way to the left) it's at 80% and says ""8",1
"0% (236.7 gb)"". does this seem correct considering there is only 60 gb free space on the drive? i can't have windows xp get messed up, will continuing harm it?",1
"i've had that problem, the only way to fix it is to repartition and install ubuntu... either that or you can try to run ""fixmbr"" in windows",1
that can happen. and its usually the fault of windows creating a corrupt master boot record,1
then you would need to get some utility to expland the windows partition and use the freespace.  but you may want to ask in #windows about all that.,1
okay well boot to windows and use fdisk to remove the linux partitions.,1

you will need to reinstall grub after installing windows - apart from that you are fine,1

i made a new ntfs partition under windows (dual bood) and after reboot i get error 17,1
i had issues with my netbook and windows 7 alongside ubuntu 10.10,1
"no, on windows you could assign free names to partitions",1
"i used partitionmagic to resize windows xp ntfs partition and make space for ubuntu, but it failed miserably leaving me with unbootable system that reboots itself in a loop - anyone knows how to deal with that ?",1
ditch windows seems like a suitable solution,1
"yea i have an asus dvdrw drive, i have done it before on windows just never ubuntu",1
is anyone in here using windows right now or have access to a windows drive right now?,1
yeah it installs it by default and automatically detects your windows installation and sets it up so that you can pick which one at boot,1
"breakdown for you here: windows 95% mac: 3.5 % linux: 1.5%, approximations",1
"well, windows always did these to me anyway",1
"question: i'm upgrading ubuntu and now it seems x (or my wm, the default one) doesn't want to render any windows etc. only my cursor is visible. can i somehow reload x without killing all the running programs, and especially the upgrade process?",1

"you're lucky, for me at some point, my iphone didn't want to be formatted/reset under windows in any way. luckily i had a mac mini or else i'd have had a beautifully shaped and designed brick :-) good to hear that it works fine for you :-)",1
"linux is not windows, you don't install windows programs in linux. you install linux programs in linux. some windows programs can be run through wine, but it is best to look for alternatives because it is not anywhere near 100%",1
what would you guys said if im using windows right now =p ;),1
it's for windows only,1
i used ephpod on windows for years and it never caused any problems. what did was winamp :(,1
their page only says windows,1
yes but their page only says windows,1
"hey, the ephpod page says that it's for windows and linux, but there's no linux download link. does anyone know where i can get the linux version?",1
the supported hardware site says that it is supported with the windows drivers.,1
yes ... it's pretty good for linux backup ... i know it can also do windows backups (but no experience here),1
"does anyone have a preference for ""home backup server"", ubuntu as the server backing up windows clients?",1
"possibly, but it's still a huge change, coming from windows to ubuntu",1
"i was recently annoyed when i had an issue during a windows boot but i had nothing to stare at but the windows logo, and i had the though ""if i was running linux, it wouldn't be hiding information from me""",1
"hey, im running ubuntu right now, but the last time i made an iso cd, i used windows, what can i use to write cds in ubuntu?",1

"have a look on the forums for ""samba"" and ""windows"". ... and at the samba manual (www.samba.org)",1
i want linux to be my internet and emulator machine and windows to be my productivity machine.,1
"well, i'm back on windows.  that didn't work at all, and it's the final straw for me and ubuntu--i had better luck with debian, and that's supposed to be a harder to use distribution.",1
there's a lot more versions of emulators for linux than there are for windows....,1
title           windows nt/2000/xp (loader),1
according to this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/windowsdualboothowto  the installer will do it for me.,1
"i'm going to be dual-booting windows xp and ubuntu 6.06.  windows xp is already installed and i have files on the drive that i would preffer to not lose.  are there any things i should look out for while installing ubuntu?  i already backed up a few of the files, but can't backup everything too easily.",1
i cannot see open windows on the panel,1
i suppose i could read it onto a windows drive if need be,1
"you probably need to intstall it on windows first,and then copy the files accross cricri",1
"plan b is to bring up a windows machine, have tech support help you get that working, then replicate the steps on linux.",1

"well, you have two windows references",1
some of my windows are transparent look: http://img365.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshot05ct4.png,1

"just doing a normal standard upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04, never had this issue befure. really seems like a windows issue",1
"everytime i do anything to my windows partitions on sda (ls, df etc), my system wont stop reading to part. sudo kill -9 won't kill the process in queston, nor will umount -f work. any ideas",1
"ah... i see, maybe you should run a filesystem check from windows (chkdsk()",1
"well, windows is shot and vista is the next thing im installing. so right now i just want to back the stuff up. do you know of a chkdsk from linux? i can always boot to a windows cd, but id rather do it from here",1

"linux is not a copy of windows, but worse...it's a different approach to things, so there might even be a completly different way of uploading images...",1
"in windows (ie), when she clicks ""browse folders"" to upload a new image, she gets a file viewer with thumbnails",1
"if i am going to run windows and linux on my computer do i give both partitions the ""boot"" flag or do neither get it?",1
what is so bad about windows?,1
have you done: smbpasswd -a 'my_windows-account_name' and smbpasswd -e 'my_windows-accoun_name' on your samba server?,1
erick you have to just find out if it works or not if it dont then use the windows drivers for xp and use ndiswrapper,1

!mountwindows | b_166-er-x,1
"and i read all about fstab, there is still something that i miss, cause i have been able to mount my windows hd but not my other ext3 hd.  hence my question here",1
"exactly : it is not a windows paritition , there is a lot of help for that, it is a ext3 formated hard rive non-os",1
"yea thats no problem. but since ubuntu is my main system for web stuff, im in there most of the time. so i wanted to see if i could get it working. booting into windows is what i was doing before.",1
ics in windows is cakewalk. just a matter of te3lling the connected adapter to share the connection and select which one to share with.,1

often the ram sits right below the tracknav and that heat could've done damage as well.. depends on how old it is and how well taken care of,-1
/dev/input/mouse0 is silent but /dev/input/mouse1 gives 2800 ff28 00ff in hex over and over,-1

the laptop is fairly new and clicking doesn't work on touchpad or tracknav buttons,-1
thanks for the help. i hope i can figure out the clicking issues,-1
i'd move on to physical troubleshooting.. i'm a certified tech but its not really rocket science even if you aren't. thinkpads have clearly marked screw holes on the bottom for which ones take off the keyboard to get in there and check the connections and for the most part those keyboards can be washed in the sink.. heh just gotta dry well before reconnecting,-1

are you sure?,-1
check its docs.. it has most features.,-1

i am pretty sure rtorrent has a built in scheduler feature. so you dont need to bothe rwith a cron job.,-1

"the update system is annoying , and  some packages  are not available for sabayon  and are  on ubuntu",-1
"if by annoying you mean ""it takes ages to install anything"" and ""it sometimes breaks"", yeah, that's true. however, the easist way to reinstall ubuntu when your home partition is encrypted like that, because they do not have compatiable package systems, etc, etc, will be to back up all your data and start from stratch. do you have enough storage to achieve this?",-1

how can i do that?,-1

i got an ati card cam,-1
thk l'll try that..,-1
cam ..i wrote the script..but i dont know how to make executable when i start ubuntu,-1
you can use pwmconfig which i think is part of lmsensors package ... if you have an i7 cpu you need sensors 3.1 ... the standard ubuntu package is 3.0.1 and is too old.,-1

most times its an external hdd why internal one ? grub takes care of the boot up,-1
"thanks a lot! but that was a lot of instructions. i'm used to only having to add 1 line into a config file, as i mentioned. but this might be a better way to do it? gnome do/synapse doesn't normally support doing anything with any files on my second hdd, maybe this will fix that?",-1
its only 5 steps and it will always auto mount your 2nd hdd and give you owner rights to that drive so you can do anything you want with it,-1
they probably have a channel on irc.gnome.org,-1

we hav e no idea about cinnamon. try the usual supported ubuntu packages and see if you have the same issue first,-1
"try using something other than cinnamon , does that work",-1
new to linux so i not familiar with all the supported packages.,-1
you were just linked to them less than a minute ago,-1
just choose one and try,-1
so thats the gnome-panel then?,-1
of course yes,-1

'till today i only knew of sudoku,-1
"hehe...that one's fun. you boot up terminal, punch in ""sudo passwd root"", set a password, log in as root, and have fun.",-1

the retarded number game,-1

take a look in /var/log/messages for anything network related,-1
"when i removed linux-image-2.6.31-21 i get a large number of error messages starting with the ""postrm hook"", specifically: ""error: cannot open `/dev/sdb' while attempting to get disk size"" and then lower down:""the link /vmlinuz is a damaged link\nremoving symbolic link /vmlinuz\n you may need to re-run your boot loader[grub]",-1
have you tried booting with the previous kernel image to see if the problem remains? are you certain it was the upgrade that caused the problem?,-1
have you looked in the log files for any error messages?,-1
"i'm not sure what error messages to look for, i had set up ip manually so that i could run it as a server, but since the update the network settings are wrong and it ignores my attempts to edit them with the network-connections app",-1
you could also try uninstalling the kernel package you installed as a last resort - the system should then revert to the last one you were using,-1
ie not zero,-1
"hi, i upgraded the kernel image package this morning on my other pc, and now networking is broken/misbehaving, is there a file somewhere that i can delete to try and revert to defaults?",-1
and the same with /initrd.img,-1

"hey guys, i have an old iomega zip 250 drive i am trying to use, i know ubuntu sees it (i ran dmesg) but it won't mount.  any ideas?",-1
what file system is on it ?,-1
"you need to give it a target also, and you may need to help it with the file system too",-1
"that was just an example, you'll need to match it for your system",-1
what command are you using to mount it ?,-1
"don't worry, its not a requirement to be a master",-1
eg: sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt,-1
ok so that's never going to work,-1
the uuid is prolly not being recognized.,-1
"no, i think it stalled",-1
it's the hdd:(,-1

yes but it has to run as root to bind to a privileged port under 1024. i have to bind it to port 80. so it binds to 80 then changes to the user i set in  the config file.,-1

yeah? ahh :),-1
woops .. let me clarify .. during the installation .. when  you pressed advanced where you normally get a list of harddrives to install the grub to ... you could only select the usb stick :p,-1
"whoa... yeah, that would mess it ujp",-1
i downloaded another release of it ;),-1
"like  ibooted the ""iso"" that i had put on a usb stick .. but it set the usb stick as sda1 ;) and the internal drive as sdb1 .. and you couldnt change it from sda to sdb :p",-1
how did you get out of that situation then?,-1
yes ubuntu was a bit weird for a while about teh grub ;),-1

its part of the linux/unix concept that a user may only handle files in her own folder,-1
you should not - thats one of the things that make linux less destroyable that other oses,-1
so there is no way to disable it then?,-1
it comes every time you do something that could potentially harm the system as a whole if you are not careful,-1

chili555  - that will turn off the adapter. is there any situation where ubuntu would be turning the wireless adapter on/off depending on usage?,-1
running over wireless,-1
"if they do do that it's likely to be a hardware specific thing, not software",-1
-  ill try it,-1
right click the network manager applet and disable the enable wireless check box. works for me.,-1
maybe signal strength related. wireless is known for dropping packets left right and center. although there are protocol arrangements to minimise disruption.,-1
try moving closer?,-1
chili555 - over ssh/remote desktop my connection keeps getting dropped. i was just wondering if this maybe hardward related,-1
under what category? i can't find it,-1
"ok, i'll check again after i log out",-1

i would just o-rx  not g-rx  because in ubuntu your user is the group name. no biggy it will work either way.,-1
"yeh, thx mate",-1
yes mine is drwx-------,-1
why did ubuntu do that then?,-1

it says that gnome-volume-control is not installed.,-1
what happens if you got the terminal and specifically run 'gnome-volume-control'?,-1
perhaps just use 'alsamixer' at a command prompt?,-1
ok good. if the package your installing has a program named 'gnome-volume-control-pulse' you should be able to use a symlink to get the applet to run it.,-1
"were on the right path, it cant run it if its not installed, thats for sure",-1
"can't start volume control: error in child process ""gnome-volume-control"" (no such file or directory)",-1

what is your definition of support?,-1
it is supposed to move the cursor in relation to how fast you move the mouse,-1
in relations to how fast you actually move it?,-1
"there is no os support per-say i believe, is it language?",-1
i doubt it without a hack,-1
or be adjusted in the mouse settings,-1
you might ask in #ubuntu-br there is brazilian and portuguese support there if needed.,-1

"you have to modify dns settings for your domain(s), so that the name resolves to your host's ip-address (create/modify a record)",-1
"yeah im new to vhosts as well, i think i read virtualmin can set them up?",-1
"ive created a vhost, what details do i change at my domain registrar?",-1
you can probably create dns entries whereever you registered the domainnames. all you have to do is setup apache vhosts,-1
create an a record? or change nameservers?,-1
"dunno, never used virtualmin. basic setup isn't all that hard, just start with the default one, copy to another and modify files to suit your needs. for further details apache help is #httpd more suitable channel",-1

i didn't fine any guide or help on google,-1
"nothing official, you may have to dig around to find something like this: http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=48",-1
"i dont have that folder, and it is already not in my bios. didnt delete it just not there",-1
with the cp command,-1
so it would be like sudo cp /etc/fstab.bak /etc/fstab,-1
disable it in the bios and in /etc/fstab perhaps,-1
k i will do that,-1
"i am comfortable with apt-get and some stuff like that, but... ya. i'll find a tutorial",-1

"you can shorten the timeout, but if you turn it off you will not have the benefits there if you need it to fix a problem",-1

no problem.,-1
have you run a update-grub after adjusting?,-1

just letting you know of the problem possibilities.,-1
try it out... it'll give errors if it cant,-1
thanks but i'd rather not waste 5 hours encrypting my entire system to find out,-1
try a small partition... it should give you the error immediately when entering the password i would assume,-1

to save a lot of time,-1
that's why i'm asking here,-1
"it basically is uploading or adding your ssh public key to the remote server to have ""password-less"" access. you can read on that...",-1
"great, thanks!",-1

i have no idea about ssh/rss keys,-1
then i can use scp?,-1
you can read on rsa/ssh keys here: http://linuxproblem.org/art_9.html,-1
you can use scp without the rsa/ssh keys but it will prompt for username/password. if you dont wnat to have to enter user/passwd then you can use the rsa/ssh keys.,-1

"maybe opere uses someting of it's own, or you installed two flash versions and they collided, dunno",-1
"as i said, that does not have much to do with the fireox update, did you have many firefox extensions installed? could be compatibility issues with them, as for opera, in what way does it misbehave? i would just grab a new version or erase the settings",-1
"how about this for extra wierdness, since i uninstalled flashplugin through synaptic, opera is back to normal and playing flash videos normally now =-o",-1
yeah i guess but i don't understand why my pages are being garbled. i think i'll just uninstall anything flash,-1
"well, confirms that it was a flash-issue :)",-1
"i know, that's what weird about it. most of the updates i did today were firefox but since i've tried to use opera because i got pissed off with ff it's started misbehaving",-1

not unless the name server is on the same domain.,-1

thatd let you say for a specific package that only security updates (but not normal updates) should come through,-1
so nobody knows how to clear unwanted updates out of update manager?,-1
"yes, that works for the moment, but they're still listed the next time update manager is run",-1
i just explained that you can lock the version,-1
"i'm not being understood here, i'll go try somewhere else.  thanks for trying",-1
lock version,-1
theyll show up but wont be selected,-1
"you can lock a package's version to prevent it being updated if you dont want to have to uncheck constantly, but be aware taht if a security update comes through for that package later, you wont get it",-1
uncheck them,-1

found that workaround via googling the problem,-1
"for me, compiz was always disabled upon reboot no matter how it was set before rebooting",-1
"ah well, that's a ubuntu problem ;)",-1
i'll see if i can find it again,-1
why did you have to use a symlink?,-1
but i got it fixed by setting up a symbolic link,-1
the terminal command i used was sudo ln -s /usr/bin/compiz /usr/bin/compiz.real,-1
"there is a slight compiz issue, but not much else i've seen",-1
so nobody knows how to clear unwanted updates out of update manager?,-1
use hold on them,-1
"that's odd, i was not aware of that possibility",-1
only if you have ff3.5 also installed,-1
shall i set up a screenshot for you?,-1

"trying to install fglrx, i get this error: ""e: /var/cache/apt/archives/fglrx_2%3a8.723.1-0ubuntu3_i386.deb: subprocess new pre-installation script returned error exit status 1""",-1
"i am sure someone else has. ask your next question, the one you really need answered :)",-1
is there any way i can completely reinstall dpkg?,-1
ok. ask it again. be patient and you can search the ubuntu forums also while you wait,-1
yeah in the display settings,-1
hi can someone help. i have lost the launcher bar after a fresh install of ubuntu. i tried to change the display setting to allowdual display instead of mirroring and it has since gone,-1
there a number of display setting apps was it ccsm,-1
i have tried installing fglrx with the additional drivers option. it will install the main driver but not the update. however after the installing the main driver still no launcher,-1
"it came up with error ""required virtual size does not fit available size: requested=(3840, 1080), minimum=(320, 200), maximum=(1920, 1920)""",-1
since this is a fresh install (less than a day) i should probably start again yeah?,-1
"ah actual resolution i missed the dual screen, not sure.",-1
where did you do this? unity right?,-1
its two screens however one is a tv (constant problems) 1080i and monitor 1920*1080. after unticking the mirror check box it came up with that error then decided to reboot and the launcher has just gone. i'm thinking of doing another fresh install but thought it was worth asking before i do,-1
"default all settings, displays",-1
is that the name ?,-1
"i re-isntalled the package network manager , but it does not appear on applet list , how to i install it on gnome bar ?",-1
and how to re-install it ?,-1
"i guess just right click on the gnome bar and click ""add to panel""",-1
"i found it in software center, so you should be able to install it from there",-1
try software center,-1
what name did u search ?,-1

the devices do not show up under /dev anymore,-1

"nope, today",-1
well it is the official release date and that is a page on their website,-1
it is out but an announcement hasnt  been released yet,-1

it's an old live cd by the way,-1

you did - please stop,-1

_jesse_ flash is crap? :p,-1
"also, if you choose to do version upgrade instead of clean install on *any* operating system then you basically creating a unstable base for future use.",-1
"of course it is.,",-1
how did you know i haven't done that? :p,-1
because you chose to use dist-upgrade.,-1
you need to make your question less confusing and vauge,-1
_jesse_ flash and *anything* don't mix well.,-1
you really should be putting your home directory onto a separate partition (regardless of the operating system you run),-1
thank you so much! :),-1
from another path,-1
to start conky each time you login - system / preferences / startup applications - add conky,-1
you actually don't need to put the path - but its /usr/bin/conky,-1
well at the path i put  /usr/bin/conky,-1
"not sure if you are using the default theme or not, but you might want to add that to the launcher ""/usr/bin/conky -c /path/to/theme""",-1
i'm using gnome but with a custome theme,-1
but what's the path to the program. sorry i'm a new user.,-1
"ohh ok, thanks.",-1
i'll give it a spin and see if this works.,-1
true just the dependencies are different and i dont want to bring any xfe into the gnome box :s but will check it out first,-1
"telephone, its a lesser evil",-1
"or i may try google planner or whatever it is called, really should put google apps into better use",-1
yes. but 4me no difference,-1
sudo apt-get install orage,-1
didnt ubuntu used to have a date/day planner?,-1
"you may try google smthng like ""ubuntu organizer""",-1
isnt that for xubuntu?,-1
"depends on the info, considering your telephone line was originally made for the military and you accepted that as a day-to-day thing i dont know how the internet can be any worse",-1
i do not like to put my private info to internet... i'm paranoiac,-1
why should they? for that there is oracle-support,-1
you can have a look at canocial but i dont think there is training for other software,-1
#oracle   its not supported in ubuntu,-1
"that is the problem with unfree software, no good (free) support",-1
i saw all over the web that oracle is now installable on ubuntu (or at least debian based distros) is it now maintained in the package manager or found anywhere as a .deb which is maintained ? and does ubuntu offer training to this field ?,-1
thanks again :),-1
seems like its moderated,-1
"well the second part of the question is ubuntu based, does ubuntu offer training in that field ?",-1
oh ok thanks i was asking cause i have a project for a company that involves getting them to use ubuntu and they use oracle so i wanted to get as much information as possible to convince them to switch to ubuntu ;),-1
what you you mean by a .bin,-1
that will never work.  you have to install java.,-1
what most people do is make a one-line shell script that calls it.  or use java web start.,-1
"you can install it anywhere, including your home directory if you don't have root, but at least the runtime (jre) has to be on there.",-1
"don't know offhand.  but just the jre isn't very big (that's the runtime engine without the compiler, etc.)",-1
"i think there are commercial programs to do that, but what exactly are you hoping to accomplish?",-1
"but java is not installed, this is a server",-1
"a binary file, eg. that in /usr/bin",-1
"i have a shell that doesn't support java but, does support .bin, since i'm a java programmer, thought converting to a bin would be good?",-1
"everytime i follow the instructions, there must be a problem, especially with tar.gz apps",-1
cant install some programs on ubuntu,-1
no problem what we need are details if you try and install utorrent do it from the terminal sudo apt-get install utorrent   then if you have an eror paste all the text to the pastebin.,-1
need some help,-1
"cant install utorrent, and some programs suggested in some websites",-1
"it may be that the websites are telling you about apps not available for example i don't see utorrent on my setup. you nhave to be sure that the apps are available, and if there is a substitute that is just as good.",-1
we need to see errors and the name of the apps use a pastebin,-1
all that i can tell,-1
its a laptop dell dimensions.,-1
what vidcard?,-1
i dont have plugins on ff,-1
"hmm its probably the flash package, try remove it and reinstall yet?",-1
did you try remove the flash package and resinstall it?,-1
all sites with flash or just some?,-1
same thing happens with chrome as well..,-1
so is there a fix for firefox crashing and basically making my system unusable when browsing sites with flash? im on ubuntu 9.10. anyone???,-1
i just thought a little more info might help someone else answer it.,-1
"my mouse is extremley sensitive, anny ideas on how i can set it more down?. already set it on the settings for the mouse but it is still too much.",-1
but its the same as in 9.10.,-1

"it doesn't just happen on one ubuntu machine, this happens on both my 10.04 machines",-1
because the pc audio works fine,-1
"having a wierd problem with my bluetooth headset.  if i connect the headset to my phone it works fine(audio received and sent), if i connect the headset to my ubuntu 10.04 machine it records just fine, but i have to plug in headphones and switch the output to headphones in padevchooser to get an audio(so, no audio on the headset).  anyone know where to start debugging this?",-1
"one is a fresh install, i hoped it would work out of the box but still no :(",-1
even though the bluetooth shouldn't be going through the pc audio?,-1
"i think the ""sound chip"" will still manage the audio routing",-1
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/hdaintelsoundhowto i think you'll need  a parameter for your audio card,-1
even if it doesn't do the d>a conversion,-1

you in the admin account?,-1
ahh had to do a reboot,-1
"hey folks, i have a remote box that i want to make a persistant ssh connection back to a server i have - ie if the power goes out, when it reboots, it re-establishes the connection.... is there a more elegant way to do that than a bash script called by cron?",-1
"yeah, a reverse tunnel",-1
"for a tunnel, i create 2 connections, local->remote and local->remote 22,  then a cron that runs once a minute and checks if it can use the local->remote 22 to get a ls, if not it re-opens both tunnels",-1
"yea, using a key with no password",-1
a tunnel or what does the ssh connection do?,-1
and stefg thanks!,-1
"so, forward local 10000-> remote 3306 and local 10001->remote 22",-1
and assuming you are using key pairs?,-1
got it! thanks and to reestablishe the tunnels you are using cron and a script?,-1
"if port 10001 cant make a connection, it re-opens both.  the check is run by cron once a minute or so",-1
im trying to connect to an ftp with a # in the password but i keep getting bad port number..how can i get around that,-1
"i tried using ""xxxx"" but it didnt work",-1
how about if you type the password from inside the ftp application?,-1
if you try and use # on the command line everything after it will be considered a quote,-1
"if it doesn't work from there, i would be tempted to say its the wrong password, but you'd know better on that respect :)",-1
"use a different ftp program,  i use lftp, ncftp is not too bad",-1
are you quoting the password?,-1
s/quote/comment/,-1
ncftp doesnt work either,-1
"i have the correct password, its just not logging in still",-1
"so i scroll back and i can only find a single usage, the problem?",-1
"not sure if its what your looking for, but dpkg --get-selections can be used to find the currently installed package list",-1
"no, pontless /me commands are just noise, please give them a rest",-1
"when it's pointless noise, yes",-1
"no, it's not a discussion, i'm now telling you to not do it please",-1
"if you want to argue it - join #ubuntu-ops and take it up with the channel operators, if you don't, please don't do it again",-1
"i still have to agree to disagree, i re-reviewed the channel guidlines as posted in the topic and your position has no basis there",-1
"i am helping someone with the 'at' command, and while reading the at command manual page i come across potentially usefull information, sharing information on default installed ubuntu programs is only noise ?",-1
shall have to agree to disagree,-1
please give the /me commands a reset,-1
"not quite sure how to address lockups at boot, you were saying something about missing /sys stuff?",-1
not missing /sys stuff... tsc errors in the logs.....  looks like a problem with how the 9.10 kernel detects/uses the cpu clock for some amd x64?,-1
"ok....  i'm fine with 9.10,but i need to get past the lockups at boot..... any suggestions?  tsc seems to be my problem...  i see lots of suggestions online, but not fixes....",-1
probably the best way is to chroot into your install and download the kernel image (whilst having internet access),-1
"you mean in the bios, or the command line options from grub?",-1
could you pointme to a step by step somewhere?  keep in mind i've already done the 9.10 upgrade...,-1
"and upgrades are never done cleanly in my opinion, you were saying that you had 9.04 and now you got 9.10 but you want to get 9.04.. which is going to mess everything up",-1
hmm you might need to disable apic support i think,-1
"is there away i can use the 9.04 live cd to reinstall 9.04 kernel?  no matter what i do, the last step of the installer always says that it will format the partition....which i am obviously trying to avoid...any help would be appreciated.",-1
how do i fix that,-1
can you paste the output of the lspci | grep vga please?  should be 1 line,-1
"i play tremulous a lot and i usually get 90fps, recently however i've been getting less that 40",-1
nvidia i know but not a 250,-1
your getting 90 fps from glxgears?,-1
what kind card do you have?  hint:  lspci | grep vga,-1
that's a highend card you may need the neouvo (sp) driver.,-1
nvidia geforce gts 250,-1
i have an nvidia cas card and am running the 185 dirver,-1
a split second after hitting enter i had the thought that maybe you were talking about a piece of software.,-1
so how about pleasing the account manager for using empathy im,-1
use whichever one you're comfortable with.  xchat is good enough for me.,-1
the damn account manager wants to know my password when launching empathy im but i type in my password. never works,-1
i don't know anything about empathy im.,-1
tell him to mind his own business.  you are never supposed to reveal passwords.,-1
"otherwise, it will take the first match.",-1
what im program do you recommend?,-1
you have to type in enough of the name to isolate it from the others before tab completion will work.,-1
yeah thats froze or not working right. what are you using? gparted?,-1
hour and a half is insane amount of time for any drive.,-1
i have a feeling the hard drive is dead. it keeps making this clicking sound. i'm not sure. i think i will let it run all night. if it ain't done by morning i'm going to call the time of death and bury the poor old bastard,-1
yeah gparted. the hard drive is still making noise like it is working,-1
"stop gparted, close it, retry it again maybe.",-1
its been running for at least an hour and a half,-1
bout 5-10 seconds guessing,-1
any suggestions?,-1
how long should it take to create a 250gb partition on an external hard drive?,-1
it may just be gparted stuck or froze. i know gparted in parted magic live cd hangs forever like that.,-1
how do i start securing my computron? ^^,-1
can a newb get a help with a security ;-;,-1
i think i have major security issues,-1
how can i protect my ubuntu system from hackers etc?,-1
what are you worried about?,-1
run ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase,-1
i think i disabled security updates,-1
someone cracking into the computer should not be much of an issue. if you're concerned you can encrypt your /home folder or even the whole hdd. one second...,-1
encrypt the hdd,-1
according to google? could be a cd rom drive,-1
and you've got the ubuntu livecd in dvdrom?,-1
no - but i want to cover all our bases.,-1
did you do a checksum of the cd?,-1
what's your boot order in bios?,-1
because we get that a lot.,-1
dvdrom-harddrive-floppy,-1
is that wrong?,-1
"the cd rom is fine, why does everyone always suggest starting there? >_<",-1
what is /dev/sr1?,-1
you said bar on the left.,-1
hit the super key that open the dash tyoe in the app name.,-1
is there anyone who can split off one on one  and help me,-1
"whiners go into my ignore i suspect many other users do this as well, it cuts down on any help you might need.",-1
it was mouse and pointers,-1
i am going to pay canical for support when they get back to me but this is absurd,-1
you have to right click and pin apps to the panel,-1
of course you are you are jumping to that instead of just adapting. ;),-1
"why when i install a program does it show up in my start bar on the left, then when i restart it is now gone from that and no where to be found on my system",-1
that usually means your filesystem itself is corrupted. i would reboot and force a filesystem check with    sudo shutdown -rf now,-1
"try that, it's possible there's a dangling node in what reiser thinks is currently free space.",-1
"and as always, make sure your data is backed up, etc before doing crazy filesystem things :)",-1
too late for that,-1
"well, good luck then :)",-1
how can i delete corrupted files like http://pastebin.com/u5kqab0p when even root doesnt have permissions ?,-1
i'll do that,-1
the corrupted files appeared after fsck.reiserfs --rebuild-tree,-1
"when you ran fsck with --rebuild-tree, did you also run it with --scan-whole-partition?",-1
running ubuntu 9.10,-1
i have this external drive formatted in hfs + non journaled,-1
"hey guys, anyone sharing stuff with a mac and linux ?",-1
on my linux box,-1
ok - but how do you format a 1tb in fat32 ?,-1
true fat32 has limitations but the best bet when data has to accessed from diferent os: fat32 is max 32gb,-1
not mentionning the limitations of fat 32,-1
even ignoring all the permissions,-1
the folder is read-only,-1
"when i create a folder in this external drive with a mac, i get permissions issues",-1
do i have to spam just to not be invis?,-1

"imma firin mah lazor!!!! blaaaaaargh!!! ok so if i press the pen down, after i release it wont move the cursor. being its not a touch screen i need it to. so i have to pull the pen out of range and bring it back. is there a fix for that?",-1
and ur question is?,-1
"lets hear it, dave. ur lucky, ur not invisible",-1
practice what,-1
no you just need to wait till someone knows what the answer is,-1
"just like walmart. every time i come here, im invisible.",-1
this is a channel for english ubuntu support,-1
"ok, but this room is just to ask questions?",-1

ah i think i see the problem,-1
restart the ssh server perhaps?,-1
still saying access denied.. does ubuntu user need relogin?,-1
you need to set the ubuntu user's password from inside the livecd session before you can ssh into use. use   sudo passwd ubuntu   to set the password,-1
"shouldn't have to, no",-1
and nothing else,-1
still stuck,-1
the second restart's just stuck there,-1
"i just finished installing ubuntu onto my xp machine, dual booting. right after the installation i restarted the system and grub loaded and i booted xp",-1
right after restarting from installing ubuntu yes but the second restart it just grub loading,-1

anyone here know how to fix this? im new to ubuntu,-1
"equally importantly, did you do anything between the first reboot, when it worked, and the second, when it didn't?",-1
at first i was able to select which os to boot,-1
i saw it trying to do download and install a new kernel when running update manager,-1
"hi,  how do you tell ubuntu not to try and ""upgrade"" your linux kernel automatically when it does all its updates? i am running an experimental kernel and don't want it to be overwritten",-1
so you reckon its ok to let it go? if it boots the old kernel my pc will become unusable :( (lack of hardware support),-1
then choose in grub which kernel to boot,-1
yes unless you change the config,-1
all kernels goes to /boot,-1
ok.. will grub boot the newest by default?,-1
"yes, and the old kernels are still there",-1
the kernel is not overwritten,-1
they are all in /boot  have  a look there,-1

"no, i want to boot from the alt disk so that i can install to the local drive (with options only available in the alt disk) is it possible to run the alt installer from within ubuntu?",-1
i don't think any of the version are available in img format.. iso is the format of the day,-1
but one of them is a superset of the other iirc.. can't remember which way though,-1
i've never used unetbootin.. but you can mount isos in linux just fine.. if that's what you're trying to do,-1
do you need an .img file for some reason? isos doesn't work?,-1
hmm.. not sure.. i don't think so,-1
i don't think so.. at least not from the official page,-1
isn't the netbook remix an img? i'm trying to use the alt installer on a system with no optical drive. it's not working as well as i had hoped,-1
"when i use unetbootin to make a usb disk of the alt installer, it stalls when looking for a cd drive from which to find the rest of the installation media :(",-1

"that just lists all the loaded modules, not hardware.",-1
whats the command to list every devices that linux reconizes ?,-1
is it lsmod ?,-1
"i have sony viao pcg u101  which it has thumb phrase, zoom and rotation button  i wanna to enable it just for shiz n giggles",-1
shiz and giggles will quickly turn into frustration and rage. you should use lsmod to check if the modules are even loaded... otherwise you'll have to go hunt for them lol,-1

"so i thought, if i have no mic working in padsp skype, then probably i have no oss properly configured",-1
i have an ordinary laptop... all this is strange...,-1
"in gnome-terminal, use the edit -> keyboard shortcuts menu.",-1
maybe check this : http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/open_sound_system#alsa_emulation,-1
sorry not much of a skype user working for a telco as some advantage ;),-1
"i wonder, why everybody use skype on linux, while i can't",-1
you want to do a alsa emulation to use oss ?,-1
"i swear, i saw selection of different devices in skype configuration before. now, only pulseaudio server (local) is the only choice there",-1
"then you should not be messing around with it :) it's just the boot menu order, leave it as is.",-1
that's done by changing the order of file in /etc/grub.d/,-1

read the readme in that file,-1
"yes i dit, but don't understad what is said",-1
"i'm trying to change the order of the different lines (corresponding to different os) in grub2 but can't find where it is, can somone help?",-1
which file do i need to edit in there? and how?,-1
so you edit this with gedit?,-1
well you need to disable or uninstall other plugins or none will work,-1
i installed mozilla-totem and i still cant see controls like play/pause on videos inside firefox,-1
"i don't see any play/pause/stop button bar on videos that play inside mozilla-mplayer (firefox v 3.6), is it normal?",-1
any workaround?,-1
i uninstalled mozilla-mplayer before that,-1
plus any way to play divx videos in firefox?,-1
use totem or gnome-mplayer plugin,-1
"hmmm, lemme search",-1
install restricted extras,-1
since when then?,-1
dont they have a mint channel here on freenode?,-1
just the normal apt-get update && apt-get upgrade,-1
its ok.. ill try #mint on the other network,-1

u did a dist upgrade?,-1
then i dunno...,-1
for some reason my mint installation now have the ubuntu loader,-1
what version?,-1
"oh that's it, thank you very much ^^.",-1
"if so, it will be fixed in the next release.",-1
"hi guys, i can not send/recieve files through yahoo in pidgin any more. any ideas why ?",-1
no problem. :),-1
or you could get a daily build now.,-1
is this the bug? http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/12213,-1
i think it's a known bug.,-1
2.6.6 has the same problem,-1
well just do it like this mkdir public_html && chown myuser:www-data public_html/,-1
every time i make a directory using mkdir it creates the folder with the permissions and group of the user creating the directory. my question is: how can i create a directory with the permissions and group of the current directory?,-1
"when a new user is created, ubuntu creates a new group with the same name as the user's name",-1
that is a lot of typing..which is exactly why i am asking my question...,-1
"yes, but this does not create the folder with the current folders group permissions..it labels the folder being created as user.user not user.group",-1
for example i am in the public_html folder and all files are permission'ed as myuser.www-data..when i create the new folder inside of the public_html folder it creates the folder with myuser.myuser.,-1
"yes, i would like the 'new' folder to be created with the current folders user and the folders group.",-1
you have to be logged into that user or w/e to do that,-1
"as a guess it looks like a fsck was run, is it asking for a password?",-1
this virtualbox?,-1
is there a way to skip this in the boot process?,-1
is there a way to skip this.. whatever this is?,-1
"i typed password, lol, but nothing",-1
"ah, not sure really.",-1
"i would not know really i have not had this problem, i generally know what i have had to do, and i keep my os's cloned and in good shape and don't mess with problems past the time it takes to reload a clone.",-1
do you what it means when the system hangs at this point? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1324848/,-1
"look for network-manager i think the source that is even newer is available,  google it",-1
"you wanted network-manager on another distro.  so that's what you could compile,  but they may already have it compiled if you checked on that destro",-1
"there is tons of help,  you can get it direct from the developers if you have a problem",-1
so what does that mean i need to do?,-1
there is a feature in ubuntu jaunty for wireless broadband setting that allows me to use my usb modem.  no other distribution has this setting.  how do i transfer it over to another distribution?,-1
with a little help yes,-1
you do know how to compile don't you?,-1
the source must be availible can't be too hard to port if it's linux,-1
it must be network-manger,-1
what do i need to compile?,-1
is the user in the admin group ?,-1
well you will need to add yourself to the admin group again. boot in recovery mode an run « adduser youruser admin »,-1
then i dunno ;) sorry,-1
"hmm i plugged in my keyboard and dvi cables to check its screen, did not even log in, tested ssh via my phone, and it could connect again. weird",-1
"well i mean i rebooted my router, all config remained the same.",-1
"i am running ubuntu servfer edition and whenever i type 'sudo su' and enter my password, it says ""[username] is not in the sudoers file"". how do i fix this?",-1
i'll try that,-1
once you can use sudo again add yourself to the other usefull groups in the same way,-1
fuse plugdev audio cdrom lpadmin kvm etc etc,-1
your nat rules where removed when resetting ?,-1
"in that directory the class file is in, type ""javap threadtest"" and pastebin the output",-1

"thx, but for some obscure reason it doesn't work. from netbeans at least it worked perfectly",-1
thank a lot ! http://www.pastebin.com/m45a272dd,-1
what does it say when you run that command?,-1

would you recommend uninstalling firestarter?,-1
i would say upto some point,-1
i remmeber running gufw a year or so ago,-1
"but .. am i wrong or isn't firestarter's settings stored in the firewall, kind of separately?",-1
i havent read much on firestarter other than it isnt supported. hence i started reading about ufw. from what i know about ufw it is a user friendly utility to configure iptables. iptables is what holds your actual firewall policies. correct me if im wrong anyone.,-1
i can see now why everyone is using firestarter. it does have much more in the gui than gufw.,-1
ufw has a nice gui called gufw.,-1
i would user ufw with the gufw gui,-1
yes. i read tonight as matter fact that firestarter is no longer supported.,-1
anyways to restore the permissions? :d,-1
its owned by gdm here. -rw-------  1 gdm  gdm  25144 2010-05-29 09:57 .iceauthority,-1
ok so is there any way to reinstall my system and keep the settings and installed programs from the old install?,-1
user settings are in their home dir. you can backup that.  as for installed apps. you can generate a list of theose and reinstall them,-1
weird. itheos  that directory is totally empty here.,-1
it has hidden files. ctrl+h will show them,-1
thanks. i will try that.,-1
oh wait. i have a .iceauthority :) ya forgot the .,-1
"i get ""could not update file /var/lib/gdm/iceauthority"" when i start my system",-1

"not sure. stability & cost probably? but thats just a shot in the dark, never looked into it",-1
so would there be any point in getting it over ddr2 800?,-1
or if its cheaper for some reason of course lol,-1
im confused too :),-1
anyone in here know if ddr2 1000/1066 is compatible with a mobo advertising support for ddr2 667/800?,-1
doubt that :p,-1
"also, what's the different between 'desktop' ram and 'server' ram?",-1

"there's no 'su' in debian-based *nix, or is disabled for that matter, though you can always do -> sudo su -;  if you wish..... but sudo should be working and is most recommended to use",-1
when i used red hat 9 it would ask for a definitive password for su-,-1
i installed ubunto i386 server. it did not ask for a password but i cannot log in as su- or root. why?,-1
"sudo is an 'execution by proxy', so is meant to be more secure than a 'su' session, though i haven't stumbled upon the technical differences heeh",-1
"depends, not sure is solely monetary, older code for older hardware is meant so, you can provide only so much legacy when it comes to code, and that applies to any programming project, os or otherwise, i think the dropping of 'support' on some older legacy  material is fully understandable, not sure how a fuel-injection system will provide me a better 1960 chevy",-1
will make what?,-1
i would have assumed that it would ask for a password on installation.,-1

"yeah, i tried that, but just got raw xml in ff.  i use google reader.  paste that in somehow?",-1
ok. thanks.,-1

just check /etc/x11/xorg.conf,-1
"well i'm especially interested in witch drivers are loaded, e.g. which pointer devices are in my running config",-1
you can get all that info from -> /var/log/xorg.0.log,-1
"then you don't have it :), but you can make one to override settings, if you want to know 'display' values, you can check with -> xdpyinfo",-1
i don't have that file,-1
i was hoping to be able to view it in xorg.conf format :),-1
can also check in 'dmsg' too,-1
i think xdpyinfo shows it closely enough :),-1
"anyone that could please help me out with some hal xorg configuration please, i'm not able to get my config loaded by xorg, i think i'm doing something wrong with my <match> tag",-1

i'll try your suggestion. thanks for your help,-1
i don't know then!  sorry.  i have to go soon and i don't have time to help you.,-1

what are you saying ?,-1
your rivendell,-1
"simply get the tarball (tar.gz) , extract it.  then you could 1. make a package ; 2. or compile it like :  ./configure --prefix=$home/rivendell && make && make install",-1

"hello, i have this problem with clonezilla. it fails at boot while trying to load the bnx2 nic firmware",-1
you know what ? the greatest thing just happened: if you leave it long enough the kernel just goes on without bnx2 firmware :),-1
you just need to unload the module and keep it out,-1
that was so easy.. i'll try to remember that... so ppa is the way,-1
thank you! i'm on it...,-1
recommended to stick with the default repositories. pokerth has not been updated yet.,-1
"no, ppa is not always the way but in this case was the only way.",-1
https://launchpad.net/~pkg-games/+archive/experimental see http://www.pokerth.net/download.html,-1
so what's the most used scenario for upgrading the app?,-1
but if you would like to upgrade the app... which way to look first?,-1
update manager will offer upgrades to apps when they are available,-1
thanks again,-1
i don't see how is that related to my question,-1
how can i increase a disk usage for my /home dir?,-1
i don't understand your sudo passwd -l root,-1

that's a turorial if i want to upgrade my php from php4 to php5,-1

i already have it installed... but it's 5.2.10ubuntu64,-1
how could i upgrade my php to the most recent stable version?,-1
"if i run sudo apt-get update, nothing happens",-1
should i avoid doing that manually?,-1
purging? how?,-1
"actually, http://nixcraft.com/ubuntu-debian/11815-how-upgrade-php.html",-1

when i try and install the wrong version it locks up my machine,-1
don't miss the restart of the desktop of the host.  gdoteof,-1
not in synaptic either,-1
libstdc++6 is already the newest version.,-1
should i download iron 32 bit on my 64 os and try?,-1
i see a lib32 but no 64,-1
did you install the one without the dev or pic? just 'libstdc++6'?,-1
lib64... does not autocomplete,-1
sudo apt-get install libstdc++6,-1
i am on crunchbang .. that uses ubuntu repos if iam not wrong,-1
"that's strange. you have updated repos and everything, right?",-1

you will want to go kde when you decide that you just cant get enough configuration out of unity/gnome,-1
what version of rekonq browser you use right now?,-1
my ubuntu does not install rekonq for me,-1
just make sure not to check a mounted partition. i read that that will ruin things. maybe it meant to 'fix' and only 'check' but i would find out and make sure,-1
with the fsck program,-1

my ubuntu disk utility is reporting that my hard disk has bad sectors .. how can i check/fix that ?,-1

do you need more help?,-1
do you know the filesystem type of the partition?,-1

if i remove alsa using synaptic and then re-install it- will it be a totally fresh slate of alsa?,-1
it was submitted to the bugzilla but karmic has yet to patch it.,-1
"no, you would have to do 'completely remove' and that might not remove everything anyway.",-1
so how would i go about doing this? perhaps completely removing and recompiling from source?,-1
nothing takes. it's a known issue for my laptop series.,-1
and you couldn't find a workaround?,-1
why do you want to recompile from source? can't you just get the stable packages from the repo?,-1
well sound refuses to work on my hp laptop intel-hda card on karmic,-1
so its a totally new program? is it 100% compatible to openoffice? can i still install and use openoffice?,-1
has openoffice renamed to libreoffice in ubuntu?,-1
ok thx i see it at the moment. i hope she'll like it :),-1
"openoffice has been forked, yes, libreoffice is a replacement for openoffice",-1
"no, it's very similar in appearance.",-1
+x if you ask me :d,-1
ah ok. is it a lot different in usability h00k? its for my gf.. she freaks if anything changes :d,-1
it will work the same.,-1

for a memtest you can just install memtest and then boot it (if you got ubuntu installed to your hdd),-1

backup scripts. does someone have to be logged in for the script to access home directories?,-1
they only seem to run when someone is logged in. i'm using the root crontab,-1
no. although... do these users have encrypted homes?,-1
perhaps your jobs are just failing if no one is logged in. what are they supposed to do?,-1
should i just make a separate directory on the system for backup stuff?,-1
how can i force cron jobs to run when there are no users logged on?,-1
i'm not really sure what to do in that case.,-1
they should always run no matter who is logged in.,-1
look at /var/log/syslog it should show when cron tasks run.,-1

copy and paste to a terminal,-1
if you mean these commands notice that each starts with lspci there are two separate commands to be run one may identify your wireless card this one or    lspci | grep -i wireless  or this command    lspci | grep broadcom,-1
"i see on the web that you probably have a broadcom card i will trigger the bot to give you info, confirm that you have this card before doing anything the wiki will show you how.",-1
try these two commands separately it probably is a broad com  lspci | grep -i wireless   lspci | grep broadcom,-1

you know the card?,-1
possibly ask the questions. ;),-1

you're unessarily compililing apps like alsa that are located in the repos ...i don't thiny will tahn you for that,-1
who doesnt edit or play music on tehir laptop?? who doesnt manager more than 1 source of audio.. flash + media player?,-1
"it's not jack, it's pulseaudio adding another layer of processing to the sound that's what is causing the dropouts and distortion",-1
look at what drivers we are compiling... they are not in the repos.. they are tehg latest from alsa itself,-1
a computer is more than just webbrowsing chatting and office documents.. its multimedia too :s,-1
"why run pulse at all , it's just another layer of processing-sound server .only those with elaborate sound systems may benefit from pulseaudio",-1
", many won't thank you for that",-1
i don't know of many ppl who actually edit video let alone audio :),-1
"...ok so you're speaking about the media types who are using ubuntu , not the guy who just wants his soundcard to work properly without crappy or no sound at all",-1
without pulse video editing is almost impossible .. and audacity wont be easy to manager. pulse plays a big role in ubuntu,-1

there's your escape: ^] send the escape and then issue 'send brk' in telnet,-1

but it doesnt stop the boot script in time,-1

maybe lower the wait time in your grub configuration,-1

"you could try 11.10, it might not have the same bug. the difference between 11.10 and 12.04 is mostly polish.",-1
"also, if you only get to a terminal, try to run apt-get update and apt-get upgrade after installing. it might help you download updated packages that fixes your bug.",-1
it often is. older versions are usually a bit more tested than the most fresh ones.,-1
i would go with 11.10 and wait with the upgrade until you know more about the problem. in the learning phase there is no need to go with 12.04 if it doesn't work for you.,-1
do you think i should try updating or just go to an older version which might have more of the bugs worked out?,-1
"ok, then it could be something wrong with the graphics setup under installation. have you tried booting ubuntu directly from your install medium - usb or cd?",-1
thank you. i will try it instead. it's probably better for new people to start with an older version.,-1
"awesome, thank you!",-1
"i installed 12.04 on my laptop with a usb stick. while installing it only showed half a screen. afterwards it showed purple, and then went black forever. if i reboot it just continues to do the same thing. it will boot into recovery mode, but still only has half a screen. i am completely new to ubuntu. does anyone know what this kind of issue is? maybe i should try an older version of ubuntu?",-1
yes. many of which are paid high rates per hour in their day jobs,-1

do you reload apparmor on 10.04?,-1

no idea but i would start by reading the two documents about locking down gnome at library.gnome.org,-1
its circular and not very clear,-1
i don't know.  i only gave that link and the other main document on locking down gnome as something for you to check,-1

"but off the top of my head i have no idea, other than sw",-1
yes. another method is also to sandwich the swap between / and /home so that the read heads can hit it while travelling between accessing the two,-1
if you had /home   then:  /home swap /root /boot         or so,-1
"with / in the middle, so to speak?",-1
something like: /root swap /boot       or so. /boot is used on bootstrap and not constantly so end is fine,-1
"ok. so /: beginning, /boot: end, swap: beginning - no seperate home dir",-1
you can also have swap /root /boot    since no separate partition for /var /home or so on,-1
"thanks, that's what i have now... well, with a big fat ntfs storage area before that, i'll have to figure out how to move that to the end sometime, if possible",-1
if you put it at the end you can put swap at the beginning. the start of the disk has slightly faster access times than the end of the disk,-1
"hey, can someone please tell me if it makes a difference whether /boot goes to the beginning or the end at installation? (location for the new partition)",-1
"ubuntu isn't a rolling release distro, the updates to packages are done on each release every six months, apart from security updates. there are some methods to update specific packages, are you after something specific?",-1

"aye, jaunty",-1
"interesting, i had no idea. i figured access to software would be something that wasn't limited to what release you were using... but then, i guess with the way that .deb packages work (i'm new to linux and just starting to understand everything)",-1
you're on jaunty or something older?,-1
"hey folks, is there some sort of way to update my package downloading sources to include more recent versions than what i'm seeing in the package manager?",-1
karmic has 2.1 though.,-1
"well, i was looking at audacious, but the provided .deb isn't the 2.2 release... it's still, i think it was 1.7 or soemthing",-1
"as i said, the packages are updated by every release, so you get newer software with newer release",-1
"/etc/ppp/ip-up, and ip-down",-1
"i have modified /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf to prepend my own domain name servers, i connect using ppp and it overrides my dhclient's dns, adds its own in resolve.conf, any way to overcome this?",-1
"i have a cdma usb, i plug it in, defined a new connect in network-manager, select connection and it connects, using ppp because the interface is named ppp0...",-1
that would be driven by the scripts that are run when your ppp interface becomes active.,-1
you can gleen what you need from this i think: http://www.technovelty.org/linux/pptp-setup.html,-1

grub basically nees to be told to look on the right drive,-1
like speme  said. - i never use a external hd. :) but i do know it can cause issues.,-1
"check out the grub menus and how to edit the grub command lines - you canproberly change some hd0,0 to be hd0,1 or somthing and get it working",-1
when installing to a external hd - thers some quirks with grub that one has to watch out for.,-1
also edit the grub line at boot to have 'nosplash' and 'nofb' at the end of the kernel options so yoyu can see all the error messages.  that may help. very likely the system is looking in the wrong place for the files to boot.,-1
hey guys... might somebody be in the mood to help me get ubuntu going?,-1
when bootintg from external hd vs internal the 'order' of the drives change - so it can confuse things,-1
because of how the installer works/sees the drives and how they change when you boot from the external hd.,-1
"i'll do that, too. sec, rebooting...",-1
tell the channel the full problem.,-1
"you have libc6-i386 installed, don't you?",-1
"gallium is old, broken and unmaintained. you won't have any luck with it",-1
i'm not sure if it is so. ubuntu should offer fglrx or nvidia driver (whatever it's called),-1
what about arch?,-1
why that junk cannot simply work?,-1
i assume ia32-lins are installed too. did you already try to reinstall your binary driver?,-1
i had same (probably) problem. i needed to reinstall amd video driver after installing ia32-libs,-1
your binary driver = nvidia or amd proprietary driver from their websites,-1

so... i got the driver from nvidia.com to work on my system now... but i still can't get a resolution greater than 640x480,-1
hmm well afaik it has to compile cleanly and *ubuntu these days use dkms.. and then xorg needs to be using nvidia driver for it to work,-1
"no no, under *ubuntu you can go through x into hardware drivers and install proprietary driver from there, it would probably save mucking around with a .run file",-1
did any of the other guys in here having the same problem have any luck fixing it ?,-1
fricking nvidia 5200 crap why is it i could get this to work at one point in debian but not on kubuntu ?????,-1
from inside a running x server ?,-1

can i send out an e-mail from their servers with the registrered adress?,-1
if you have a domain gmail will let you use their servers with your domain for free,-1
no you can actually have your domain use the gmail servers. its a feature. clearwire and a few other companies do it,-1

"it sounds like the application has had its file cache reduced to next to nothing, or it has been swapped out, to me.",-1
"if you have large number of swap pages in use (last line, second value), that indicates something is writing to swap a lot. similarly, if the cached value is very low -- it's usually 100-200 mb, i bet -- then that could also be evidence of some kind of memory pressure.",-1
"is that from the % column, like using 3.4 % of memory?",-1
how can i tell?,-1
"it's like this: i click a button for the first time in several minutes, it animates like it's going down, then the app ""grays out"", and then it actually reacts. for several minutes after that all the buttons in that app will work just fine.",-1
"then it should not be a memory issue, because 3 gb is very difficult to exhaust in normal circumstances...",-1

"well wol in dd-wrt works but some machines seem to work differently, don't ask me why, i guess it's a bios thing, 150 computers and only half will wol",-1
lol dd-wrt was complicated enough,-1
"i was running dd-wrt for a while, never got that to work tho",-1
ok well stay away from tomato lol,-1
wol i've found to be very iffy on working with all computers,-1
"either use that or tomato both are awesome, and you can get more power out of the router, linksys i assume?",-1
tomato is like dd-wrt (kinda) but it's more advanced,-1
wol works if the system is completely shut off?,-1
that would be a hardware feature would it not?,-1
"someone follow me on this one: lets say a malicious script is saved as an ""image"" with an extension of .jpg, couldn't there be a way for gnome to encorporate a feature that tells the user that that file is a script, and not an image, document, music or video file (as most users automatically open such files without considering of viruses)",-1

my problem is that when watch anything on youtube using flash the video is choppy,-1
i have a decent computer so i think it shudnt happen,-1

"there are three options in software centre - adobe, swfdec, and gnash. do you know which?",-1
and there is lag in it,-1
"yeah... sounds like the computer's fine... flash is generally just extremely bad on linux, and adobe isn't terribly helpful. sorry... i'm out of ideas. anyone else have ideas as to problems with choppy flash video on youtube?",-1
"bad news - adobe (the people who make flash) do a notoriously bad job of making their linux version. flash on linux is always touchy. good news - there are options. first, how did you install flash?",-1
"sure. so - you did this through synaptic, or through add/remove, or through the software center?",-1

i had some files on a vdi file that had no os installed. nor does it have guestadditions installed. how can i get those files from that disk?],-1
its proberly possible to convert them where you can mount them directly,-1
those are virtualbox drive images right?  if so make vbox mount them to its  system and boot a live cd image..  then copy the stuff whefer you want,-1
how can i use ssh? install opensshd on the vbox and then ssh it?,-1
the vbbox guest may be faster way.. but ssh can do it. :),-1
or ssh out from vbox to the host os..,-1
sudo apt-get install openssh-server then write ifconfig and ssh into that ip,-1
ok now logged in to host system from the guest box via ssh. how to transfer those files ?,-1
then drag and drop files,-1
places > connect to server and then make the protocol ssh and write in the ip and username then click ok and it will prompt you for a password,-1
ok thanks  will try     thanks dr_willis to give a push in right dircection,-1
are you using ubuntu on the host system?,-1

yea  doin that,-1

coz flash drive is 8gb,-1
dr_jesus_: wilee-nilee: hibernate ya means keep idle,-1
i want to install the os what i should keep the partition sizes on 8gb flash drive,-1
if you load alot of apps in memory and your system freezes. try running a memory test.,-1
will then 5 gb good for the rest of os,-1
yes wilee-nilee,-1
my current install crashes if too much apps loaded,-1
"well if you never done that, then i guess everybody says something not worthy :).. so try it :)",-1

you just doesn't use the full potential of your processor,-1
so i can assume this is 64-bit since it's running?,-1

because i can't :< works with wep and open networks,-1
nah i'm on my craptop,-1
"i get ""deauthenticated (reason 15)"" in my dmesh",-1
"trek, why would it do that?",-1
so has anyone here got wpa authentication to work with ubuntu + ath5k,-1
the problem is i have no idea what it could be,-1
"trek, i'm like 100% positive that i'm using the right wpa key",-1
"can someone enlighten me as to why /sbin/{init,runlevel,killall5} and various other executables have their permissions randomly changed to 000? filesystem issue?",-1
"*nod*, i don't enjoy needed to take out a rescue disk, mounting, changing the permissions back when my system wont boot",-1
i believe upstart provides /sbin/init,-1
its a fresh install,-1
i'd report a bug,-1
it doesn't sound like a filesystem issue anyway,-1
what did you do in the run-up to that?,-1
it randomly switches back too.,-1
well afaik ubuntu isn't really using old-style init,-1
(man networkmanager.conf<enter> shows the manual page),-1
i was in your place a few years ago..,-1
"there's alot of outdated documentation out there.. there's acutally cli command for nm (nmcli, nm<tab><tab>)",-1
takes time to get used to,-1
but the only thing i have in there is an auto up for eth0  and i thought that nm put that in there,-1
and bring it back up it gives me a message about waiting another 60 seconds for the network to start?  then when the desktop finally does come up i have to wait another 60 seconds for the wireless to start working,-1
ive see that happen when there is some crazy stuff in the interfaces file (aparently network-manager is not a big fan of that now,-1
so for some reason now when i shutmy laptop all the way down,-1
wtf is that all about?,-1
"you shouldnt touch the interfaces file, unless you completely disable networkmanager, or if you have network-manager configured not to touch interfaces defined configured by the interfaces file",-1
php injection..do u know?,-1
or a good shell,-1
who knows about php,-1
what ya wanna know,-1
"you're not being very clear,",-1
what type of php injection,-1
i dont know how i can get a shell,-1
how to install the non free one?,-1
see my post to you above,-1
any one can guide me?,-1
what did you install to get flash working in the first place?,-1
did you already install ubuntu-restricted-extras?,-1
i installed ubuntu-restricted-extras but i still have the same problem,-1
"hi all, i have problem with my flash player on firefox, i want to delete it and install it again",-1
"if you installed the package mentioned by warriorforgod *and* you installed ubuntu-restricted-extras then you have 2 different flash packages installed.. they are interfearing with each other.. uninstall the ""non-free"" version",-1
then don't bother with the non-free version of flash.. just install ubuntu-restricted-extras,-1
it is downloading 1350 package,-1
i am stuck with same issue,-1
"hi, i'm trying to upgrade using an alternate cd (without having to download new packages now due to a very slow connection). but it keeps wanting to get new packages ... pls help",-1
"not required, in case of cd, u will b still mounting it",-1
"i guess no one in room knows the answer, google is helpless 2",-1
"let me know if you find a way out, disconnecting from net doesn't help :(",-1
might just have to burn cd instead of mounting,-1
"true, wonder if more googling will help",-1
"yes -- just checking software sources, and it doesn't know a cd exists",-1
"not finding much on google - think might just go for a full reinstall, atleast get ext4 functionality",-1
"hey, has anyone else noticed ubuntu being exceedingly slow?",-1
it takes almost an entire minute to open the terminal,-1
does it do that on a blank page,-1
apparently firefox is using 90%+ cpu o_o,-1
is all your ram being used by something?,-1
"i've run ubuntu on less than 512 without problems, make sure compiz is turned off",-1
"only have ~2.5 gb free, would that be a problem ?",-1
ok i'll look for that also but i can't seem to find anything related to chosing the output given my audio controller. maybe i'm lacking the correct words for google,-1
with lspci ?,-1
start with lspci | grep hda or lspci | grep alc,-1
"- yeah, looks like you are correct.  the second line ""hewlett-packard company device 30a4"" might also be relevant",-1
"there is nothing, i pasted the output of lscpci",-1
"if there's nothing there just do lspci and look at it manually, carefully",-1
- i don't think that's the one - look for intel hda or for alc.,-1
it looks like the only sound related device : http://paste.ubuntu.com/584830/,-1
- sorry for the delay in getting back to you - was in the next room watching rage - it is amazing tonight. re your lspci -vvnn output at http://pastie.org/2741167 - 512k is probably right.,-1
"i think its the ""prefetchable"" one",-1
"ok, ignore that.  well spotted.  i remember when a 512k video card was the bees knees.  you could get a resolution of 800x600 with 256 colours with that!  the info beside region 2 in your output is probably correct - 256mb",-1
rly? its 512k not 512m lol,-1
http://pastie.org/2741167,-1
run lspci -vvnn and let us know what is printed beside region 0,-1
"i'm not sure if that is always accurate, but it is on my system",-1
just region 0?,-1
"sorry, that should be region 0 of the section for ""vga compatible controller""",-1
"make sure you are looking at the primary one and not the secondary one, if there is in fact a secondary one (there may not be)",-1

no problem... keep ffmpeg for later use though ...it does come in handy :),-1
first make sure it is installed   sudo apt-get install ffmpeg,-1
have you tried that yet?,-1
then cd to the location of the file you want to convert  then in terminal   ffmpeg -i nameoffile.wavpack  to nameof.mp3  or flac  or ogg,-1
no...i haven't used it,-1

fill the bug against all those? then let the maintainers to sort it out :p,-1

64bit includes new instruction sets that improve lots of other things,-1
but i guess its more related to ##hardware,-1
