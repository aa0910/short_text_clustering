"it sounds like the application has had its file cache reduced to next to nothing, or it has been swapped out, to me.",-1
"if you have large number of swap pages in use (last line, second value), that indicates something is writing to swap a lot. similarly, if the cached value is very low -- it's usually 100-200 mb, i bet -- then that could also be evidence of some kind of memory pressure.",-1
"is that from the % column, like using 3.4 % of memory?",-1
"how can i tell?",-1
"it's like this: i click a button for the first time in several minutes, it animates like it's going down, then the app ""grays out"", and then it actually reacts. for several minutes after that all the buttons in that app will work just fine.",-1
"then it should not be a memory issue, because 3 gb is very difficult to exhaust in normal circumstances...",-1
yes,-1
"it's somewhat matter of expertise. linux has a program called ""free"". it can be run in a terminal and it tells vital system statistics.",-1
"then it will start all over again :/",-1

"jus got a new router, maybe ill slap dd-wrt on it and give it a worl",-1
"well wol in dd-wrt works but some machines seem to work differently, don't ask me why, i guess it's a bios thing, 150 computers and only half will wol",-1
"lol dd-wrt was complicated enough",-1
"i was running dd-wrt for a while, never got that to work tho",-1
"ok well stay away from tomato lol",-1
"wol i've found to be very iffy on working with all computers",-1

"tomato is like dd-wrt (kinda) but it's more advanced",-1
"wol works if the system is completely shut off?",-1
"that would be a hardware feature would it not?",-1
"someone follow me on this one: lets say a malicious script is saved as an ""image"" with an extension of .jpg, couldn't there be a way for gnome to encorporate a feature that tells the user that that file is a script, and not an image, document, music or video file (as most users automatically open such files without considering of viruses)",-1
