switched windows?

thanks lot

"i use ubuntu his server centos"
"a. _no_ idea you're take rhca b. build rpms .deb based system"
anyone here build srpm ubuntu platform
"if anything get redhat box try rpmerizor"
best tell why you're doing tell you're going wrong.
"i src rpm older package replaced tar.gz file modifed spec file match. don't know todo turn srpm try build rpm"
"my friend wants done his server think would good thing know because rpm standard redhat based systems"
_why_ doing this?
"cross-reference usernames against launchpad find someone seems important then highlight them."
"it would probably help start by saying ""i question about wiki license noticed you're major contributor. answer few questions?"" something that."
that's i'd point anyway. you're likely get higher-quality/more reliable response there.
sure that's rude thing do?
ok. thanks. :)
what's best place ask about ubuntu team wiki license?
#ubuntu-doc doesn't too people.
thanks! :) that.
"irc highlights aren't usually considered rude good reason singling out individual. unsolicited pms bad though."
tried yesterday today. nobody replied...
big list known issues network manager?
"i only use wireless rest sod off leave alone."
"""networkmanager."" you've list."
"i already know about these things (given source fully tagged redhat copyrights i'm surprised)"
"so main problem causes problems by being obtrusive rather geuinely helpful?"
being serious. i'd really know more about why everyone seems hate it.
mean something ug tracker. something informal.
"it stomps hardcoded configuration assumign knows better wants."
works inconsistently.
"yes there's comprehensive list."
im ressing ctrl+c
there's escape: ^] send escape then issue 'send brk' telnet
"uhm send break ;-)"
doesnt stop boot script time
"pici problem doesnt seem get there"
send brk mean?
"no this"
script made capital letter
connected 192.168.0.1. escape character '^]'. == executing boot script 1.910 seconds - enter ^c abort
send ^c over telnet?
maybe lower wait time grub configuration

"you could try 11.10 might same bug. difference between 11.10 12.04 mostly polish."

often is. older versions usually bit more tested fresh ones.
would go 11.10 wait upgrade know more about problem. learning phase need go 12.04 doesn't work you.
think should try updating just go older version might more bugs worked out?
"ok then could something wrong graphics setup under installation. tried booting ubuntu directly install medium - usb cd?"
thank you. try instead. it's probably better new people start older version.
"awesome thank you!"
"i installed 12.04 laptop usb stick. while installing only showed half screen. afterwards showed purple then went black forever. reboot just continues same thing. boot recovery mode still only half screen. completely new ubuntu. anyone know kind issue is? maybe should try older version ubuntu?"
yes. paid high rates per hour day jobs

yes. another method also sandwich swap between / /home read heads hit while travelling between accessing two
/home then: /home swap /root /boot
"with / middle speak?"
something like: /root swap /boot so. /boot used bootstrap constantly end fine
"ok. /: beginning /boot: end swap: beginning - seperate home dir"
also swap /root /boot since separate partition /var /home
"thanks that's now... well big fat ntfs storage area before i'll figure out move end sometime possible"
put end put swap beginning. start disk slightly faster access times end disk
"hey someone please tell makes difference whether /boot goes beginning end installation? (location new partition)"
