that's classic answer. don't know particularly windows-centric about per-application network control. linux comes with per-port or per-ip access control kernel - strikes per-application logical third option. windows security people realised 10 years ago. people ubuntu forums spent 10 years telling people it's so great already just don't need it.
per-application firewalls standard windows. i've probably been through least 5 time. week ubuntu can't even find one. i'm watching stuff from default install merrily connect out speak
switched windows?
"this ""only windows heads want per-app firewalls"" reasoning sounds like defending ubuntu by trying turn deficiency into feature. again don't understand why it's unreasonable want control network access application basis. best argument against i've heard basically linux apps more trustworthy. don't work level face-value."

can anyone help with that?
"errors with cd usb installation process or errors cd usb media? type errors stage?"
did not. figured would have worked with flash drive it'd been iso burning error right?
"retry from live-cd before pressing enter start loading check off few extra booting options found by pressing f6 least try checking acpi=off noapic options there see checking others may help"
mean?

antivirtel: please disable going idle channel.
"this server i'm now has 4 cpus. so load average was 4 would mean all 4 cpus were being used 100% time. load average was 1 then only quarter cpus would use."
"this means have 1 cpu average 1(or more) cpu used all time right? ""a load average 1 means single cpu loaded all time while 4 cpu system means was idle 75% time."""

was -azvv tag.
finally backing up music right now with rsync. taking long time! every day will always take long?
"yes incremental backups live saver. have gui server would recommend ""sbackup"". simple easy works"
so backup does from server directly usb drive? or via ethernet or something?

why just use 'dpkg' uninstall old kernels?
mark@localhost:/boot$ sudo dpkg --remove initrd.img-2.6.27-17-server
try this... dpkg -l '*2.6.27*'
that's correct package name
ok thanks lot !
you're welcome
"why just use dpkg synaptic or aptitude uninstall old kernels?"
dpkg: warning: ignoring request remove initrd.img-2.6.27-17-server which isn't installed.
hmm enough disk space /boot sudo apt-get clean doesn't solve it. can just manually throw away some old kernels or does screw up grub?

pressed upper menu : system > administration > hardware drivers installed from there
did use restricted driver manager install drivers?
ok probably installed old drivers.
how can install new drivers ?
start with dowlnoading newest drivers from ati.com
"so seller happy now with money :( any idea how can fix ?"
"also 32 or 64?"
hint: ati + linux = bad
http://www.overclock.net/linux-unix/509761-how-linux-ati-driver-installation.html follow those instructions
"hello installed ubuntu 9.10 new machine after installation pressed hardware drivers button installed video card driver (my card : ati radeon hd 5770 ) after rebooting get msg box right corner : ""unsupported hardware"" resolution went bad .. idea ?"
there way can check have pcmcia 'enabled' ubuntu? bios not. i'm just familiar with laptop hardware end things
"so you're saying check there first then come back with new problems :)"
"basically there any way see 9.10 pcmcia bus enabled or so by default?"
pcmcia card isn't getting any power. i'm 9.10 with toshiba a305 according other sources should work. i'm getting any power light card itself.
how reliable other sources? ;)
go bottom work way up ;)
they can't help have hardware failure ;)
yes all looks good
well connected?
"you can check bios os unrelated ;)"
can only suggest trying live cd. see can mount stuff by hand
"i got grub error 17 so booted into rescue mode with ubuntu disc...got point choosing root partition tries mount says mount failed"
new clean install?
"yeah thought about doin too guess gonna work :/"
"if partition wont mount rescue mode does mean probably dead?"
hmm.. sure about that. always mount stuff by hand when fixing grub.
any error messages when mount by hand?
odd suddendly started doing that. could hd failure.
"no server backup server required restart restart gets grub1.5 then gives grub error 17 stops cant any thing else hence rescue mode"
"no router cant find desktop."
"nope seems like isnt. where cable enters there orange light always has been.. maybe should try some linksys-specific forum question? ill google it^^"
"i found something called like dhcp-ip table said only laptop was connected"
"so desktop connected okay look behind pc desktop there ligth by network card connector blinking color tblinking"
does nic card teh desktop work (ie functional)
"hi! just bought new linksys router have problem acces from desktop-ubuntu while laptop-ubuntu has no problem accesing it. just got out box did fresh install. have tried couple reboots both desktop router. could problem?"
"nope cable plugged into lan connection router wan connection right well pushed ?"
try connecting teh cable from desktop another port router coudl bad port
"k just checking.. when goto router webpage (see manual) can see router ""see"" desktop ?"
nic card? network card working because used previous louse router earlier today..

"as near can tell from reading online there no disadvantage using aptitude - every package available apt-get available aptitude?"
use apt-get install packagename
so tutorial going instruct people install packages from command line should use aptitude?

remove alsa using synaptic then re-install it- will totally fresh slate alsa?
was submitted bugzilla karmic has yet patch it.
"no would have 'completely remove' might remove everything anyway."
so how would go about doing this? perhaps completely removing recompiling from source?
nothing takes. it's known issue laptop series.
couldn't find workaround?
why want recompile from source? can't just get stable packages from repo?
well sound refuses work hp laptop intel-hda card karmic

hehe.. copy it.. will impress regarding freedom gives ram
"try write ""free -m"" then paste code terminal try ""free -m"" again"
backup scripts. does someone have logged script access home directories?
they only seem run when someone logged in. i'm using root crontab
no. although... these users have encrypted homes?
perhaps jobs just failing no one logged in. they supposed do?
should just make separate directory system backup stuff?
how can force cron jobs run when there no users logged on?
i'm really sure case.
they should always run no matter logged in.
look /var/log/syslog should show when cron tasks run.
"hey all i'm brand new ubuntu (and linux general). can anyone give hand with wireless?"

"it's jack it's pulseaudio adding another layer processing sound that's causing dropouts distortion"
look drivers compiling... they repos.. they tehg latest from alsa itself
computer more than just webbrowsing chatting office documents.. multimedia too :s
"why run pulse all it's just another layer processing-sound server .only those with elaborate sound systems may benefit from pulseaudio"
" many won't thank that"
don't know many ppl actually edit video let alone audio :)
"...ok so you're speaking about media types using ubuntu guy just wants his soundcard work properly without crappy or no sound all"
without pulse video editing almost impossible .. audacity wont easy manager. pulse plays big role ubuntu

"here's thing: person owns domain name. person b (me) owns hosting. b set up addon domain with hosting provider. want person point his domain name addon domain. beofre configuring his domain use dn servers want make sure addon domain domain servers. that's i'm trying accomplish. :-)"

thanks lot
"in other versions sure i'm running 9.10"
sudo apt-get install alsamixergui
then launch (alsamixergui)
so fresh install ? install alsamixer first see driver loaded right channels being unmuted
did before ?
"not fresh install didn't test sound until yesterday may have broken something up by sometimes logging root was someone told here have alsamixer gui will install"
audio doesn't work :/

"i use ubuntu his server centos"
"a. have _no_ idea you're take from rhca b. dont build rpms .deb based system"
does anyone here no how build srpm ubuntu platform
"if anything get redhat box try rpmerizor"
best tell us why you're doing so can tell where you're going wrong.
"i have src rpm from older package replaced tar.gz file modifed spec file match. now don't know todo turn into srpm so can try build into rpm"
"my friend wants done his server think would good thing know because rpm standard redhat based systems"
_why_ doing this?
"cross-reference usernames against launchpad find someone seems important then highlight them."
"it would probably help start by saying ""i have question about wiki license noticed you're major contributor. can answer few questions?"" or something like that."
that's where i'd point anyway. you're likely get higher-quality/more reliable response there.
sure that's rude thing do?
ok. thanks. :)
what's best place ask about ubuntu team wiki license?
#ubuntu-doc doesn't have too many people.
thanks! :) will that.
"irc highlights aren't usually considered rude have good reason singling out individual. unsolicited pms bad though."
tried yesterday today. nobody replied...
there big list known issues with network manager?
"i only use wireless rest can sod off leave alone."
"""networkmanager."" there you've got list."
"i already know about these things (given source fully tagged with redhat copyrights i'm surprised)"
"so main problem causes problems by being obtrusive rather than geuinely helpful?"
was being serious. i'd really like know more about why everyone seems hate it.
mean something other than ug tracker. something informal.
"it stomps hardcoded configuration assumign knows better than wants."
works inconsistently.
"yes there's comprehensive list."
im ressing ctrl+c
there's escape: ^] send escape then issue 'send brk' telnet
"uhm send break ;-)"
doesnt stop boot script time
"pici did problem doesnt seem get there"
does send brk mean?
"no will this"
have script which made capital letter
connected 192.168.0.1. escape character '^]'. == executing boot script 1.910 seconds - enter ^c abort
how send ^c over telnet?
maybe lower wait time grub configuration
so can't pick any options? don't reccomend that.
wanted can
don't know grub2.
it's necessary ?

"you could try 11.10 might have same bug. difference between 11.10 12.04 mostly polish."
"also only get terminal try run apt-get update apt-get upgrade after installing. might help download updated packages fixes bug."
often is. older versions usually bit more tested than most fresh ones.
would go with 11.10 wait with upgrade until know more about problem. learning phase there no need go with 12.04 doesn't work you.
think should try updating or just go older version which might have more bugs worked out?
"ok then could something wrong with graphics setup under installation. have tried booting ubuntu directly from install medium - usb or cd?"
thank you. will try instead. it's probably better new people start with older version.
"awesome thank you!"
"i installed 12.04 laptop with usb stick. while installing only showed half screen. afterwards showed purple then went black forever. reboot just continues same thing. will boot into recovery mode still only has half screen. completely new ubuntu. does anyone know kind issue is? maybe should try older version ubuntu?"
yes. many which paid high rates per hour day jobs
"take break from uberleetness would ya"
still don't know talking about..
there lots per-hour-gurus here though
"ok whatever"
problem? was pointing out there lots skilled people here. seem have taken offence some reason?
"i was just saying there plenty volunteers here earn awful lot money linux work during day jobs. thus channel has lots ""per hour gurus"" too"
"this channel full volunteers per-hour-gurus"

"normally yes just trying think why dvr would cause collisions or conflicts."
have nothing configured port forwarding
need dvr off network first. then plug se there's change.
good thing :-)
everything's plugged working
"ok think it's just very finnicky switch"
"just glad back up runn'en dont brick ur router wiht fw upg !"
wouldn't port forwarding have configured router?
no mac address conflicts

"if new linux general gentoo will hard ( though you'll learn lot )"

"what ""easy"" lightweight distro will recommend then since xubuntu isn't working"
"slackware can light it's easier than gentoo though less walk park"
"gerry_: know too! lol thanks anyways man im gonna try other light distros & see happens"
"but off top head have no idea other than sw"
yes. another method also sandwich swap between / /home so read heads can hit while travelling between accessing two
had /home then: /home swap /root /boot or so
"with / middle so speak?"
something like: /root swap /boot or so. /boot used bootstrap constantly so end fine
"ok. so /: beginning /boot: end swap: beginning - no seperate home dir"
can also have swap /root /boot since no separate partition /var /home or so
"thanks that's have now... well with big fat ntfs storage area before i'll have figure out how move end sometime possible"
put end can put swap beginning. start disk has slightly faster access times than end disk
"hey can someone please tell makes difference whether /boot goes beginning or end installation? (location new partition)"
"ubuntu isn't rolling release distro updates packages done each release every six months apart from security updates. there some methods update specific packages after something specific?"

you're jaunty or something older?
"hey folks there some sort way update package downloading sources include more recent versions than i'm seeing package manager?"
karmic has 2.1 though.
"well was looking audacious provided .deb isn't 2.2 release... it's still think was 1.7 or soemthing"
"as said packages updated by every release so get newer software with newer release"

why junk cannot simply work?

"use package manager make sure know kernel using now it's always good thing keep known working older kernel."
"but ext fs better handling lots files where xfs far better large file storage."
don't touch bios unless you're certain it's problem know update fixes it. could end up having take into pc repair shop paying them reflash because won't boot up. :d
another nice thing about xfs minimal cpu use
"xfs will work 32-bit or 64-bit os's only difference max partition size 8 exabytes 32-bit linux 16 exabytes 64-bit linux"
"boot = ext2 /root home dir's ext3/4 or riserrfs or storing bog files xfs"
"you probably used cxfs version xfs tailored clusering"
isn't xfs also better suited 64-bit os ?
would probably better went via hardware drivers install restricted drivers
so... got driver from nvidia.com work system now... still can't get resolution greater than 640x480
hmm well afaik has compile cleanly *ubuntu these days use dkms.. then xorg needs using nvidia driver work
"no no under *ubuntu can go through x into hardware drivers install proprietary driver from there would probably save mucking around with .run file"

how can tell?
"it's like this: click button first time several minutes animates like it's going down then app ""grays out"" then actually reacts. several minutes after all buttons app will work just fine."

start with lspci | grep hda or lspci | grep alc

"there nothing pasted output lscpci"
"if there's nothing there just lspci look manually carefully"
- don't think that's one - look intel hda or alc.
looks like only sound related device : http://paste.ubuntu.com/584830/
- sorry delay getting back - was next room watching rage - amazing tonight. re lspci -vvnn output http://pastie.org/2741167 - 512k probably right.

sse-instructions also usable when using 32bit (just need newer cpu which normally have amd64)

guess more related ##hardware
"no 64bit just larger memory-register all other new features cpus doesnt have with 64bit"
there no new instructions 64bit

thats true
